# Q&A

* Vocab hotseat!  Got some vocab getting you down? Or a concept that's giving you fits? Let's throw it on the board and clear things up.
* When to use variables:

* Your Logical turtle shuld be in the same pull request as your Turtlehack, but in a different post (dated Tuesday).  If any of this doesn't apply to you, fix it now.

# Introductions

Finally!  Let's get to know each other a little.

# Turtlehacks

[Pair up]({{ site.baseurl}}/pairup.html) and merge up!

Let's share!

# Looking ahead

* My Treasure hunt game, demonstrating click events and with an instructions animation:

# Backing up: Anatomy of a function

I never really got **parameter** vs **argument** until late in my career.  Now you know :)

# Q&A

* What's `.md` stand for?  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (as opposed to markup- get it?).  Here's another [cheatsheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html)
* List indices
* `Ctrl-/` is your friend
* While True, continue and break

* what `try`/`except` does to your program

* sum & python keywords: don't pick special words for your variables!
* program flow & breaking
* Reminder on help
* `None < 1`, truthiness, and other wierdness

# Escape Velocity

My goal for all of you is to get you into orbit, able to keep learning on your own and
ready for a wide range of new technologies.  Let's recalibrate what success means.

# Today

Review the *boatload* of homework you did.  Now.

We're doing more chapter 8 exercises, but more importantly we're learning
a technique called **pair programming**.  This is both a real technique used
by professional programmers and a learning strategy that's been shown to
improve outcomes.  Double win!

First, a [warmup]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/gerund-challenge.html)

Next, more exercises.  Complete these in a pair programming style, then have both partners submit the same code. [Let's go!]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/ch8-more.html)

# Next Time

**Clickyhack turtle.**

Again, another open-ended exercise for your to make something unique.  You've got **Lots** more tools now, but you may not know how to put them to use.  Combine your ideas with the things we've learned to make a program that uses all of the language features we've covered so far, starting from a helpful template I made for you.

**Reflection on the Class So Far**

Far and away, the students who reflect the best, perform the best.  This is your opportunity to either continue your reflection excellence or bring it up to speed.  Use terms from class like problem solving strategies, attitudes, challenges, and lightbulbs to describe your journey so far.  Help me (and yourself!) understand your path.

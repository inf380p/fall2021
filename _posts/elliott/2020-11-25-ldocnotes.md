Happy Last Day Of Classes!

More to follow.

# Q & A

* Strategies for everyone's code:
  * encapsulate 'naked' code
  * Group like things into Classes.  Variables => Attributes  Functions => Methods etc.
  * Manage scope: pass things you'll need inside functions/methods in as arguments, `return` things you'll need afterwards
  * Definitions of functions and classes are great candidates for putting into custom modules (new files) as long as you manage scope correctly.
  * Your main.py file should succinctly communicate what your program does **overall**.
  * Tweak/iterate.  Analysts: this means thinking of new ways to view your data.  Turtlers: this means small alterations to your games that make them more fun
  * Everyone: make sure your interfaces are **robust** and **graceful**.

# Thank You!

As I said on the first day of class, I love teaching, and you've been a great group who's worked hard and learned a lot over a very short period.   Thanks for a great summer session!

Please keep in touch on various social media.  I don't always use social media, but when I do, I use Twitter.  Drop me a line if I can help or you've got a fun

# Stay involved!

- Meetups & open source contributions are a great way to stay motivated and stay inspired
- RE Meetups: believe in the strength of weak ties!  When you show up a second or third time you'll be amazed at how much easier it is to break the ice.
- There are tons of great nonprofits doing good work for kids- share what you know!
- [Kickstarters like this one](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lesbianswhotech/the-lesbians-who-techs-edie-windsor-coding-scholar) are
a direct way to improve diversity in our field.
- Be an ally for an underrepresented group!


# Keep hacking!

Paul Graham has written that the way to win at startups is the same as the way to not losing - [Don't Die](http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html).  In
other words, the main criterion of success is whether you keep going.  I think this is exactly analogous to success - whatever that means to you-
in programming.  You win the same way you avoid losing: keep going.

I've tried to make this class a safe and encouraging space for you to try lots of things and get messy.  The real world isn't a lot different
except you'll find spaces that will be more or less encouraging and, hopefully, over time, things get a little less messy.  But it's still just humans and code.

Just know that whatever role you want programming to play in your career, you can get there if you keep going.  Things get way easier
after liftoff, when your rate of learning becomes exponential.  But regardless of your trajectory, you've found problem solving skills and
attitudes, along with a significant knowledge of Python, that have equipped you to get out there and do real things.  The Final and all
the apps you've made are proof enough of that.

# Project Updates

Last one of the semester.  Make it count!  You should have most of the functionality of your project done and be working on stretch goals or
perfecting the details.  If you're not, use your group to make sure you've got a plan to catch up!

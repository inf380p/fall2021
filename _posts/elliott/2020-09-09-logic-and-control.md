# Q&A

* Community engagement - Get started now!
* Open Source contributions - now Extra Credit

# Logistics

Moving forward, you'll review and merge each others' work in class.

Review, fix, and close issues assigned to you. We'll have some catch-up time where
we can review any outstanding issues.

# Merging!

With great power comes great responsibility

* Never merge your own pull request
* Never commit directly to the `master` branch

* Never merge broken or failing code
* Always be explicit with your reviews:

# Review & Merge Posts

Volunteer: Merging with Tommy Tester.

* Reviewing PRs - comment on them directly
* Create a formal Review to **Approve** or **Request Changes**.  Leave comments on a specific line if needed.  Request changes on an open PR.  Open an issue if the code has already been merged - that way, issues are with the current site, and problems with new code say in the PR.
* Merging - Your responsibility to make sure your partner's post works! Check that it shows up on our site afterwards.  Code > Commits will let you see whether the site has been rebuilt (takes ~1 minute)
* Assigning issues - already merged work with problems

~10 minutes reviewing & merging posts with a partner.

# Discussion: Logic and the Flow of Control

Boolean values are very simple but very powerful.  There are tons of useful ways to
construct **expressions** that evaluate to `True` or `False` in Python, and we use these
to change the behavior of our program.

Basic `if` statements act as 'gates' to control whether blocks of code get executed.
`elif` and `else` statements enhance this control.

# In Class exercise

Logical Turtles!

# Logical Turtles code talks

* Story of your approach
* Your triumphs
* Your despairs
* Problem Solving attitudes and strategies

# Functions & Refactoring for Next time

Read up on functions and then use the power of custom functions to make your previous code more concise and more awesome!

# Q & A

* Four (4) hours of Open Office Hours over the coming week: Friday 11-1 and Weds 12-1 and 2-3 (normal class time, minus a research presentation I need to attend). Grab a 15 minute slot Fiday, and/or drop in on Wednesday.
* Strategies for everyone's code:
  * encapsulate 'naked' code
  * Group like things into Classes.  Variables => Attributes  Functions => Methods etc.
  * Manage scope: pass things you'll need inside functions/methods in as arguments, `return` things you'll need afterwards
  * Definitions of functions and classes are great candidates for putting into custom modules (new files) as long as you manage scope correctly.
  * Your main.py file should succinctly communicate what your program does **overall**, due to well-named variables, functions, etc. and good use of custom modules.
  * Tweak/iterate.  Analysts: this means thinking of new ways to view your data.  Turtlers: this means small alterations to your games that make them more fun
  * Everyone: make sure your interfaces are **robust** and **graceful**.

# Agenda

Part 1: Course retrospecitve and final project requirements review
Part 2: Course evaluations
Part 3: Final standup and in-class work session

# Did we meet the course objectives?

These were the course objectives set out at the beginning of class:

* Have the skills required to solve problems by creating and modifying programs and systems, using modern programming tools.
* Have the knowledge of basic programming concepts, their appropriate usage, and how and where to learn more.
* Have an attitude of confidence when reading, writing, or discussing computer code
* Students will be prepared to integrate these skills and knowledge with other iSchool courses in Databases, Web Development, User Experience and others.
* Students will also be well versed in common tools and workflows used by developers and development teams.

How did we do? If you feel like any of these are not true for you, *don't worry*: there's still time. A large part of the *synthesis* of what you've learned happens during the final project. All of what we've done in the first class sessions prepares you to care about and know enough about Python to learn it through doing.

If there's anything that hasn't 'clicked' for you yet, the next week or so is when that can happen!

As for confidence about your abilities, let's not forget how far we've come...

# Looking back: how far you've come!

Think back to the beginning of class. Here are some of the things you said then:

What excites you about coding or learning to code?
* It can be a great way to creatively express myself
* I view learning to code (and, I suppose, coding itself) as a type of creative problem solving
* I am excited to learn a subject that has always intimidated me
* I love the idea of being able to engage more with technology
* I like the idea of being able to create or edit programs so they work for the specific way I want to do things.
* I think what excites me most about learning to code is just that, when I feel like I'm truly learning.

Do you have any apprehensions about code or learning to code?
* I don't like that coding is literal. If you're off infinitesimally, you're wrong
* I have some experience but no formal training
* One thing that I find really daunting is the amount of jargon and terminology that you need to remember
* I am nervous about learning something so new to me
* I worry that the way I solve problems through code isn't necessarily the most efficient or straightforward.

What are your goals for this class?
* Looking forward to developing a cool extended project to represent my skills
* I hope that I will be able to use this course knowledge in my future profession (multiple responses: academic librarian, UX designer)
* I want to become competent at the processes of learning to program
* My primary goal is to become comfortable with the language of programming.
* I'd like to learn more about how to collaborate with other people/how to "be a programmer" in general.

These are the "before" picture. Hopefully you've found ways to engage and deepen your excitment, mitigate and overcome your apprehensions, and acheive some of your goals.

The code talks on December 9th will be our 'after' picture. Each of you will present a substantial, working Python program, and talk insightfully about it and your process of making it. You've all deepened and added to your skills and knowledge about programming.


# Thank You!

As I said on the first day of class, I love teaching, and you've been a great group who's worked hard and learned a lot over a very short period.   Thanks for a great summer session!

Please keep in touch on various social media.  I don't always use social media, but when I do, I use Twitter.  Drop me a line if I can help or you've got a fun
update to share: [eah13@utexas.edu](mailto:eah13@utexas.edu)

# Stay involved!

- Meetups & open source contributions are a great way to stay motivated and stay inspired
- RE Meetups: believe in the strength of weak ties!  When you show up a second or third time you'll be amazed at how much easier it is to break the ice.
- There are tons of great nonprofits doing good work for kids- share what you know!
- Be an ally for an underrepresented group!

# Keep hacking!

Paul Graham has written that the way to win at startups is the same as the way to not losing - [Don't Die](http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html).  In
other words, the main criterion of success is whether you keep going.  I think this is exactly analogous to success - whatever that means to you-
in programming.  You win the same way you avoid losing: keep going.

I've tried to make this class a safe and encouraging space for you to try lots of things and get messy.  The real world isn't a lot different
except you'll find spaces that will be more or less encouraging and, hopefully, over time, things get a little less messy.  But it's still just humans and code.

Just know that whatever role you want programming to play in your career, you can get there if you keep going.  Things get way easier
after liftoff, when your rate of learning becomes exponential.  But regardless of your trajectory, you've found problem solving skills and
attitudes, along with a significant knowledge of Python, that have equipped you to get out there and do real things.  The Final and all
the apps you've made are proof enough of that.

# Final Project Review

The final project is designed as a lens for you to look back over the content you've learned and apply it holistically. Commonly, things finally 'click' during this project. That's in part because the best way to learn a programming language is to try to do something with it.  I've tried to design the final so that anyone can find something interesting about it, but make no mistake: it's the energy, curiosity, and drive that *you* have found in your project that's powering your learning.

Let's take a final look at the [project requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/final.html) to make sure you've got them all in mind, and have a plan to include them all in your project.

# Don't fear starting fresh, even near the end

**Don't be afraid to start fresh**. This may sound scary, but let me explain.

In the first part of class, we started over nearly every week. Now, you've been working on one project for several weeks. One project doesn't mean one draft of a program. If your program's getting complext, it might help to start fresh to test out an idea or isolate why something's working the way it does. That fresh start might teach you something that you bring back to your final, or might be something you build your existing work into.

At all different levels of complexity, new phenomena emerge. Adapt your problem solving strategies as they do! Find a way to simplify so the problem ebcomes clear: then solving the problem becomes easy (and you easily learn something new!).

# Part II: Course Evaluations

You should all have received an email from big UT's eCIS system for this class. Please locate it now.

Evaluations are a huge part of how I make this course better for my next students. Please fill out the survey, especially any qualitative comments.

These are anonymous. You're welcome to send non-anonymous feedback to me directly as well.

After you've completed your evaluation, take a break!

# Part III: Project Updates

Last one of the semester.  Make it count!  You should have most of the functionality of your project done and be working on stretch goals or
perfecting the details.  If you're not, use your group to make sure you've got a plan to catch up!

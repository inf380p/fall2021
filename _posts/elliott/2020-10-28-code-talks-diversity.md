# Q&A

* App peer review & self refleciton cancelled.  Not enough time!
* I will merge up your project ideas and provide feedback as I do.
* Another batch of meetups!  Observations?

# Code Talks

Pair up & merge up.

First up: Turtle

Next up: Blackjack

# Diversity & Inclusion in Programming: Group Discussion

You have a new superpower.  SILSHack for good!

The readings for today

- Silent Tech Privelege
- Python's Diversity Statement
- We're not Done Yet

Circle up & let's chat a bit.

# Classes

Classes are recipes for making objects.  They allow you to use familiar notation to define methods, similar to functions, and attributes, similar to variables.

Here's an example you'll see in your reading:

You can also base classes on preexisting ones.  This is called **class extension**.  Here's an example of how to make a `BoxTurtle` class, which is a turtle but different in key ways we specify.

For homework, I want you to use this new knowledge to improve an existing trinket, both by refactoring it and by adding some new feature using the abilities of classes.

Volunteer for an example?

# If there's time: Midterm Review

Let's go over these questions.  Or we can do it next time.

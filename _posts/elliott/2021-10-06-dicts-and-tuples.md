# Dictionaries

Group work

Write a program to record in the dictionary message_count the total number of messages from each domain name (not the whole address, just the part after the @ and before the space). At the end of the program, print out the contents of your dictionary. The domains should be the keys of the dictionary, and the counts of the domains should be the values of the dictionary.

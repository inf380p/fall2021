# Announcements

* Who's attended a meetup yet?
* Read the assignment: it's at the bottom of the materials page (and has been for weeks, by the way).
* Meetups *do not* need to be about Python. They can be about any _programming language_ or topic. NodeJS, Ruby, and Go are examples of programming languages/frameworks that have meetups. You may not understand much about the langauge, but practice your skills of learning. And, of course, note what the group is able to do to help newcomers join.
* *You should have one picked out by now*, since they're usually scheduled at least a month in advance, and we're about a month out from the end of the semester (!). Remember, since the requirement can be satisfied virtually, and many events are online or hybrid now, you have the option to attend meetups from all over! If you can't find what you're looking for in Austin, you have lots to choose from.
* The writeup pull request can be submitted now if you feel comfortable doing so, or you can just save the text of the writeup for later in the semester, when I'll make sure everyone can get it submitted.

# Q&A

* Any questions or vocab I should make sure to cover?


# Diversity & Inclusion in Programming: Group Discussion

You have a new superpower. Hack for good!

The readings for today:

- Reflecting on Being Black in Computing
- Silent Tech Privelege
- Python's Creator Thinks it Has a Diversity Problem.
- Python's Diversity Statement
- We're not Done Yet

## What's diversity got to do with _me_?

Kimberlé Crenshaw's idea of _intersectionality_ is a framework for thinking about how diversity and inclusion connects to each of our unique, overlapping identities, and connects us to each other.

Intersectionality was a legal framework Crenshaw developed in the 1980s for demonstrating that, amongst other things, laws designed to protect women were not adequately protecting _black_ women. The intersection of these two legal identities, black and woman, created a specific inequity for these women. And yet, courts were not addressing this problem because, in the text of the law, "women" were protected, and "race" was protected. Intersectionality is a legal theory Crenshaw developed to expose these harms and enable legal scholars and policy makers to better address them. Intersectional legal harms still exist.

The idea has since been expanded and used in a variety of non-legal contexts to add nuance to the discussion of how race, gender, ability status, economic status, nationality/immigration status, sexuality, and so on intersect in individuals' identities, and the effects these overlaps have. It's a powerful tool for making discourses about identity more nuanced.

In addtion to intersectional harms, there is the concept of intersectional privilege. This framework can help identify ways in which privilege overlaps with marginalization. Someone might experience racial discrimination but have privilege that arises from their sexuality. Or vice versa. By including a way to talk about privilege alongside discrimination and harm, we have yet _another_ tool for making our discussions with each other more nuanced and, hopefully, fruitful.

## Nuance

So, why is the nuance that intersectionality provides so important for a discussion of diversity and inclusion in programming? It's been important in exposing ways in which _certain combinations_ of identities (such as white, male, straight, cisgendered) have at times come to represent a default human being in law, media, computing, and other spaces. In a discussion like the one we're about to have, I think the unbundling of identities it enables helps us see the ways in which we're connected while still holding space for our differences. We can talk about all of the threads of identity instead of needing to pick a single one, or a subset of them.

I want to talk about _your_ experiences of inclusiveness, or lack thereof, in technical communities. 'Community' can mean in person, online, or even written output, such as blogs. While there are undoubtedly malicious people in some technical communities, sometimes, the vast majority of non-inclusive spaces come from ignorance and/or apathy preventing people from taking inclusive action. Inclusive action takes knowledge, thought, and effort, and the spaces that put in this work are hugely different than those that don't.

## Discussion

Some questions to seed our discussion:

* Have you felt welcome in technical spaces? If so, what contributed to this? What actions resulted in that?
* If not, what _lack of actions or knowledge_ contributed to this?
* What inclusive actions have you seen from yourself or your classmates in this space?
* How might you take inclusive action outside this technical community?

Please reference the readings, or concepts like intersectionality, throughout as needed.

Some ground rules:

- Use "I" statements. Focus on your lived experience best you can, instead of speculating about others'.
- Respect others' "I" statements, and avoid defensiveness or assigning blame.
- Listen actively, and seek understanding. Be open and curious about others' experiences.
- Hold space for their experiences to be different from yours, and yet seek commonalities as well.
- Think of these rules as inclusive actions that we're taking together to make our classroom community welcoming and open.

If you believe someone is not adhering to these rules during your discussion, call me in.

These discussions are always powerful, and can at times be uncomfortable. There's some mutual trust that enables the kind of examination of discomfort that will make this session a success. Let's earn that trust from each other and make our technical community even more inclusive together.


# Next Week

## Diversity Reflection

On Canvas you'll find an assignment asking you to write a reflection about your discussion in class today, and your thoughts on diversity and inclusion more broadly. Please give it time and thought!

## Final Projects Plans

I want you to read the final, think about what you want to do, and maybe get a trinket started. See the assignment for more.

# Code Review & Talks

Misha will pair you up in breakouts.

1. Review each others' pull requests and discuss any formal aspects of the pull request (formal as opposed to the content). This is to check in about whether submitting pull requests with posts is starting to click yet.
2. Read each others' reflections, and run each others' code. Discuss this exercise, challenges, lightbulbs, problem solving strategies, and so on.

# Make a name for yourself

Our class website knows who you are now! Well, kinda. You'll fill in the blanks now.


See the [exercise](/exercise/make-a-name-for-yourself.html).

You and your posts are now on the [people page](/people.html).

*If any of your posts don't have a listed author and don't show up on the people page, what you entered as `author:` in the file doesn't exactly match what's in `_config.yml`.* We'll go through and fix things like this later, but you're welcome to do so now if you think you know how.

# Self-directed work

Use any remaining class time to work on assignments for this class.

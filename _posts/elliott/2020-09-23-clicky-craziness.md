# Recommended Reading

With many concepts, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that
link for more info on **return values** and **scope**.

# Questions & Answers

* New filename tests!  Let's see them in action.  (More tests coming soon, as I have time to hack)
* Should you ever **commit to master**?

# Peer Code Review

This is where those of you who have been commenting, reflecting, and pull request titling will
win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.

Pair up

* Review & merge your partner's PR (opening issues if there are any)
* View their live post on the site (merge any PRs they need to do to get the post to display)
* Fill out the [Turtle Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvZakeibjHMQS8gFhgsWi7MGu3k66zc4YEp53l8iLKvUWG-A/viewform?usp=sf_link) form.
* Submit
* Discuss with your partner
* Group up & compare notes.  Show off the partner you reviewed's code to the group
* What did you you learn?
* Show off a partner's work in front of class

Your partner will get a copy of your feedback after I review it.

# Looking Ahead

Major projects coming up soon!

* Clicky turtlehack: Due June 4th
* Reflection on the class so far: Due June 4th
* Blackjack text game or Turtle Drawing App: Due June 11
* Final Project due June 20th

The latter two will have intermediate assignments.  Scope them out ahead of time, particularly if you don't have much time between Monday and Tuesday classes!

# Next Time

Lots of work over the break!  Pace yourself.  Start early.  We've got to keep going so we don't fall behind.

* Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
* Chapter 6 reading & exercises.  **Strings** aka text.  Super fun.
* Chapter 8 reading & exercises.  Lists.  Super useful!
* Recommended: Automate the Boring Stuff Lists and loops.

Why cram all these together?  Well, they're related.  Loops are loops **over** a list.  The familiar `range(4)` produces a list.  `for i in range(4)` produces the list `[0,1,2,3]`, assign each of them to `i` and completes the code in the for block.

Strings are just lists of characters, with additional methods (like `.format()` and `.contains()`) built in for our convenience.

So, it's a lot of material, but doing it all at once should help it all sink in.

# Announcements
- What's in a reading assignment? (Arrow button/link at bottom of page screenshare)
- Panopto tab on Canvas has class recordings
- Please access your Runestone exercises from Canvas
- Special Cultural immersion opportunity: ["Technically Wrong" discussion group](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpjPecrguyeslYPy6CZOP9GZsH9Ca4qjiZCcE8P6mfBSrbA/viewform). Contact me *first* if you'd like this to be your cultural immersion activity instead of a programming meetup. It will be significantly more work, but has the potential to be an even more valuable change to experience and analyze cultures of computing and technology.

# Vocab and Q&A
- "high-level" as vocab word & cultural token
- "stack" in programming languages, and systems.
- Others?

# First reflection

Know where you are and how you're feeling, then take action.

These reflections were really really excellent. Nice work, crew! Some selected quotes follow.

## Knowledge (lightbulbs)

* "My lightbulb moment was when the book discussed and provided the below chart for the keywords that are used in Python. When I saw this, I felt like I had to screenshot it as it validated for me that there was no such thing as people being predisposed to knowing Python, it was something that I could learn also! Because this gap in knowledge was filled, I was no longer intimidated by the content because it felt like with this out of the way, everything else was easier."
* "The "lightbulb" moments really came when I had a study session with a classmate, where we went though the activities and talked about where we each felt some confusion. Almost everything she had trouble with, I was able to explain to her, and vice versa. Not only did talking someone else through the process (like pair programming) really cement my understanding, it really helps to have another person's perspective and reasoning on tricky problems."

## Attitudes (feelings)

* "One aspect of coding that I feel encouraged by is that there are wrong answers but there is not necessarily one, set, right answer"
* "As someone who spent a lot of their undergraduate years writing papers, I am approaching coding in a similar fashion. I have never written a paper with zero errors on the first try so why should my coding be the same at this point?"
* "One thing that I need to remind myself about learning code is that it is learning a new language....I have to consistently remind myself to have patience and to continue practicing."

## Skills (actions)

* "I am setting goals for myself in the next few weeks. I intend to continue to devote time to understanding the practice problems assigned each week. I also will continue to work on being patient when errors are made, to reflect on why they were made, and to accept that this is going to be a continuous learning process. In class, I would like to participate more as I become more confident in my programming. I am looking forward to the group work and collaborating with others and learning from them. Overall, I am proud of myself for taking this course and trying to learn a subject that had previously intimidated me."
* "The method that has helped me best in learning has been taking notes systematically for each section per chapter (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) in the assigned reading. Taking notes for important terms/concepts, and noting key takeaways from the mini-exercises has helped me in retaining a lot of the information presented."
* "One tool that I have been using to help learn all of this new vocabulary has been a continuous glossary. I found that by copying the end-of-chapter glossaries, in addition to other keywords discussed in the chapter, I can have a quick and easy reference for when I encounter a confusing but familiar word while doing the exercises."
* "I find that when I return to the material after a few hours or on the next day, things flow a little more smoothly."

## Self-awareness

* "I learn best when I have access to an answer key or explanation of the problem."
* "I _am_ worried by the speed of the instruction. We seem to be moving very fast and I wonder how things will look two months from now"
* "I tend to veer on the side of just wanting to learn the bare minimum so I can perform a task, rather than taking the time to think through the concepts and apply what I’ve learned to the hands on activities"

# Agenda: 4 Pomodoros & A Wrap-up

Pomodoro 1: Group warm up. Not graded, so go [straight there](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/py4e-int/functions/func-group.html)


Pomodoro 2: All together


Pomodoro 3: Pairs


Pomodoro 4: All together

# Wrap-up
Lots of work for next week: start this week!

- You told me in your reflections that the exercises were helpful to test what you've just read. So I've added some back into the readings.
- They will be graded for interaction, but you're doing the ones with answers. Try them first, and use the answers to learn. The only person you can cheat is yourself if you skip ahead to the answers.
- There are both ActiveCode and Parsons versions to the mixed up code questions. For extra challenge, do some or all from scratch using the ActiveCode version.

Strings: we've been using them all along! But you'll read about all sorts of cool things they've been able to do that you didn't know about. Data types in Python can have **methods**, which are function-like things attached to types. So, all along, strings have been able to do things like `"some string".capitalize()`

Files: A logical addition to strings, files are how we store stuff in secondary memory (the hard drive). Reading files most often produces, you guessed it, strings.

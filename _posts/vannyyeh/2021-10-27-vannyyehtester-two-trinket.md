# Reflection

The beginning of the turtle function was handy and the ‘forward,’ ‘right,’ ‘left’ function is easy to understand and apply. However, it becomes more complicated 
when I have been asked to add more functions like ‘pinup’ and ’setheading’. Those functions are easy when it comes individually and I don't have any confusion 
about its function, but it’s pretty changeling when it comes once. 

I was trying to do line by line like before and make the logic clear. However, it’s not as helpful as before. The line-by-line strategy is functional, but it can’t
solve the issue and find the bug. The lightbulbs for the turtle(which I think could apply for the more extended codes in the future) is checking all the variable
names, limits, and function. My bug happened because of the limitation of what I set up. 

Turtle is the core of the language. Therefore, I imagine that the turtle is an object and I tried to put myself in it and the coding process becomes vivid and I 
will understand the order of the codes (for example, when do I need to use the penup and when should I put down the pen).

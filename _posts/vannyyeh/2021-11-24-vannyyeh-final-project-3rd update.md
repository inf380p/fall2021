# My 3rd updated work plan

  I had a good meeting with my classmates from last class time. Two of them are also approaching data-based programming. Andrew Reiter assist me on how 
  to get good data from a good website and we walk together to subscribe to the Trinket and it magically solves my main issue (can't import a specific 
  function).It's really helpful and encouraging from the meeting I had with Andrew Reiter and Sung Joon Roh. 
  Therefore, my work plan is to make the game run by using API and historical data. Besides, I will make a good input for users to enter/exit the game 
  without any syntax errors.

# Reflection

  It's really interesting while dealing with the game by thinking about all the circumstances when the user might accidentally give a wrong input and cause 
  the game to stop. Therefore, I was trying all the cases that would happen and I will go back to the codes and give it a solution. For example, when the 
  user gives a non-exit city name, it can rerun the game from the beginning or just asked a new input. I end up restarting the game by building a restart 
  function. 
  However, I am quite of a delay on this project because I haven't found a proper CSV file to import into the trinket. The one I had is too large to run on 
  this server. By that time, I will have the `for` loop ideas.

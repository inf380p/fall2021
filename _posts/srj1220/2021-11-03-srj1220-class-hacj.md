I have a lot of fun working with the turtles, and have even played around with them just for fun several times now. While working on this, I was able to solidify my understanding of using random integers within ranges to do several things. I used them to scatter the turtles across the screen, randomize the star side lengths, and to fill the stars with random colors.
The only thing I had a bit of trouble with is that I would like to make different stars different sizes while maintaining equal lengths for their sides.
I'm really exited to see what else I can do with the turtles, especially in regards to making a game. I ended up generating a lot of turtles for this assignment just because I enjoyed seeing what random location and color would be produced with each one.

## Turtlehacking

Now that we know a little about how to make Turtles do cool stuff, let's [hack](http://paulgraham.com/gba.html) them!

The Turtle library is code that someone else wrote for us.  You can see the full extent of that code [here](http://silshack.github.io/fall2013/turtle.html). We went over lots of the Turtle module's functionality [in class]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/turtle-basics.html), and you can find more if you're interested online.

Use what we learned and what you discover about turtle to make your program as cool as possible, whatever that means to you.

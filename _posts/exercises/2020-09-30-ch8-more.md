Some more lists exercises to keep you in the groove.

**Exercise 4**

Write a program that asks for a filename, opens it, and reads it line by line.
For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split function.
For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the list, add it to the list.

When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

```
Enter file: romeo.txt
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already',
'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief',
'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft',
'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window',
'with', 'yonder']
```

**Exercise 5**

Write a program to read through the mail box data in `mbox-short.txt` and when you find line
that starts with "From", you will split the line into words using the split function.
We are interested in who sent the message, which is the second word on the From line.

```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
```

You will parse the From line and print out the second word for each From line, then you will
also count the number of From (not From:) lines and print out a count at the end.

This is a good sample output with a few lines removed:

```
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
louis@media.berkeley.edu
zqian@umich.edu

[...some output removed...]

ray@media.berkeley.edu
cwen@iupui.edu
cwen@iupui.edu
cwen@iupui.edu
There were 27 lines in the file with From as the first word
```

**Exercise 6**

Rewrite the program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum
of the numbers at the end when the user enters "done". Write the program to store the numbers the user
enters in a list.  Compute and print the **median** and use the max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum numbers
after the loop completes.

```
Enter a number: 6
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 9
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: done
Maximum: 9.0
Minimum: 2.0
Median: 5.0
```

Submit a pull request with a short narrative update on your progress since last class,
along with your (almost final!) list of milestones (checked/unchecked as appropriate), **and a snapshot of your code** in
Trinket. To make a snapshot, duplicate your project and embed the duplicate **and don't work on the duplicate anymore**.  Address how your actual work compared with your plan from the previous update.

**Include both the old plan and your new modifications (if any)**

Include a reflection, where you may want to consider:

* Are there any roadblocks ahead?  Is there anything your group can do to help out?
* Are your milestones ambitious enough?  Make sure to include some stretch goals.
* Are your milestones too ambitious?  Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding
into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
* Are you able to keep to your plan?  Looking back at what you've actually done, is the difference
accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or
something else?

Explicitly state what you're working on next and what you intend to accomplish before you turn in your project.

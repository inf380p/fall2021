**Note:** There's a line in sales.csv that has bad price data in it (a `"` and a `,`).  You'll need to manually clean this when you find it.

Tips:

* Pay attention to variable names, especially if you copy/paste code!
* Pay attention to data types!  If you need to convert a value so you can for instance do math with it, do it as early as possible. Then convert it back to a string when you need to print it.
* Look back at the chapter for inspiration!

published: false
---

Submit a well-formatted pull request with a 500+ word peer review of your partner's
drawing app and a reflection on your own experience making your app.

Your peer review/reflection should contain the following sections:

# The app

Review the requirements for the assignment.  Your partner's app should satisfy them.  Did it?

What strikes you about your partner's app, its functionality, and its interface?  What did they do differently?

Here are some categories to keep in mind:

- App
 - Creativity
 - Usability
- Code
 - Organization
 - Comments
- Process
 - Milestones
 - Design
 - Improvement


# The code

The assignment stated that the code should:

* Utilize custom modules for readability and organization
* Utilize custom functions for modularity
* Utilize definite loops (i.e. `for` loops)
* Run without errors
* Be well-commented
* Be well-organized and readable
...in addition to a few app-specific requirements.

Did it?  How did your partner's code contribute to the app's functionality and interface?

# The process

Looking over your partner's reflection, initial milestones and final milestones, how did they
approach this project?  Did they adapt their process in response to challenges?  Were their
milestones clearly stated, acheiveable, and collectively sufficient to satisfy the project
requirements?

# Self-reflection

How did your partner's app, code and process differ from yours?  What can you learn from them?
What did you like about what they did?  What did you dislike?  Looking back on your work,
how would you evaluate yourself?

Submit a well-formatted pull request containing a **snapshot** of your drawing app.  You still have a few days to perfect it and your partner will help you with any problems you're encountering.

To make sure that the code you embed for this post is frozen, use the **duplicate** button in Trinket to make a copy of your app and embed the copy.  Then you can continue working on your app without altering the snapshot.  The snapshot will also help me see the evolution of your code.

Include a short reflection and a list of things you want feedback on, have questions about, or want to discuss with your partner.

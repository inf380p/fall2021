I participated in The Austin Python Monthly Meetup.
Before participating, I thought that such a meetup was very serious, and everyone seriously discussed technology-related issues. But to my surprise, it was completely different from what I thought, and it was actually very interesting.

Participants came from different countries and regions, and different cultures. Even foreigners like me without any coding skills were treated with enthusiasm and kindness.
During the whole process, firstly, some technical experts shared their own work results, about the robot operating system made with python, and then everyone discussed it together. I was impressed that he wanted to name its system foxy, because the movement of this robot is very flexible and fits its characteristics. After that, another person shared his own demo of simulating autonomous driving with python, which was really interesting.

Later in the process of small talk, I can see someone posting job information. It turns out that this is also one of the channels for finding a job!

A lot of the content discussed in this meetup is too in-depth, I may not be able to understand, but I still learn something. On the one hand, I knew a lot of open sources and learned a lot of tools that can be used in their fields, which opened the entrance of interest for me. On the other hand, the atmosphere of the event is very infectious to me. In the past, I always liked to work, study code-related knowledge by myself. In this event, I felt that everyone, regardless of their technical ability, whether they are beginners or not, are very happy to work with others and share their specific problems and feelings in their study and work. In this course, I was also inspired by the same. The sharing process of code with other people can really solve many practical problems and increase my interest in learning.
This is a regular monthly meetup. One of the interesting things I remember is that someone is creating intro music for this meetup event, which makes me more interested in participating in the next meetup event.

In the past, in such events, I was more of a listener and learner. I want to participate in such events in the future, I can have some of my own small achievements and learning experience to share with others. I am looking forward!

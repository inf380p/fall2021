# Video on Scope

In these videos you can see men **make and recover from mistakes live**.  I tell myself that it's OK to
make mistakes- I'll just turn them into teaching moments for my students.  But for real we all encounter
unexpected errors.  I that's one of the things bothering you, check out how I do it in these videos and
see if my methods help.  THere are also several points when I write less code then I know I want and run
it to make sure there are no bugs and everything behaves as expected.

Watch each video and code along with it, pausing it to try things out for yourself.

Here's the video I recorded going over some tips for working with scope in custom modules with Turtle:

Here's the video I recorded going over turtle's Screen more in depth.  It should complement the O'Reilly video well.

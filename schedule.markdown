## Scehdule Outline


**Note to potential students: the five part outline below is the best indicator of what the Spring 2016 class will cover**
Part I: Collaboration with Github and the Basics of Python with Trinket

For this part we will use the free [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/) book by Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck).  We'll be using the [in-progress Python 3 version](https://github.com/csev/pythonlearn/tree/master/book), which I'm lending a hand with. Yay open source!
 For this part we'll also use a variety of free web-based resources such as [this Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

* Posting to our Jekyll Website via Github.com
* Using Github issues and milestones to track progress
* Submitting Pull Requests
* Passing Tests
* Merging Pull Requests
* Writing Python Programs with Trinket
  * Variables & objects
  * Flow of control: Loops & Logic
  * Functions
  * Opening files
  * Importing modules
  * Instantiating objects
  * Regex
* Projects
  * Hangman program
  * Text search tool
  * Data parser

Part II: Interactive Python Programs

For this part we will use [Python Game Development for Beginners](http://www.infiniteskills.com/training/python-game-development-for-beginners.html) by yours truly.

* Interactive Programs with Turtle
* Custom Classes & Class Extension
  * Methods are functions
  * Attributes are Variables
* Screen state in Turtle
* Decorators
  *  Functions are objects
  *  Decorators are Functions that modify functions
* Projects
  * Drawing App
  * Basic TurtleChase game

Part III: Git & the Command line

For this part we will use custom tutorials I have written.

* Hello Cloud9
* Command line basics
* Command line Git
  * Adding & Committing
  * Branching
  * Pushing & Pulling
* Editing our class website via Cloud9

Part IV: Python & the Web

For this part we will use the free [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/) book by Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck) again.

* Chapter 12: Reading webpages from Python
* Chapter 13: Using & parsing web data (XML & JSON)
* A Command-line Twitter Bot
  * API access
  * HTTP GET & POST

Part V: Final Project - Turtle Game or Twitter Bot

Your final project should be a demonstration of mastery over the various tools, processes, and concepts
we've covered.  You may be able to build directly upon the exercies we've completed or code you've already
written.  You may find examples, walkthroughs, or tutorials online to help you.  

* Creating new github repos
* Public projects with Cloud9

* Common project features:
  * Public, well-commented/documented source code
  * Publicly deployed
  * Write-up detailing project goals, scoping and next steps
  * Proper attribution to all sources, code, and collaborators
  * (Bonus) Collaboratively authored, with well-formed pull requests, issues, etc.
* An interactive Turtle game, using trinket
  * Custom Classes
  * User Interface
  * Help Text
  * Levels
  * Game State Readout  
  * Uses images
* A Python Twitter bot, deployed on the Internet
  * Use of local files for customization or storage
  * State change/evolution over time
  * Read data to Twitter
  * Write data to twitter
  * Autonomous and user-driven modes
  * Bonus: with Web interface

Other final projects are possible, with approval from me. For instance, fully functioning web app as described in Chapters 14 and 15 of Severance's book with customizations of your own design would be entirely acceptable.

# Class Schedule

Here's a rough schedule so you get a sense of where we're going. The official due date of each exercise and reading will be available on the [assignments page]({{ site.baseurl}}/assignments.html) by the time you'll need to start on it. So that's the page you should check during the class.  This is more of a roadmap to keep us on track.

1. None (first day of class)

In-Class: Get set up on Github

In-Class Exercise: Modify the class blog

* In-Class Exercise: Write an initial blog post

* In-Class Exercise: Open your first issue

* In-Class Exercise: Close your first issue

* Note: As we’ll learn, `git` is an open source command line version control system.  Github.com is the fastest growing `git` repository on the internet.  This distinction isn’t always immediately apparent.

Read the text, do the exercises, and be prepared to explore what Turtles can do in class.  The videos are optional- I find them less helpful than the text myself but you might find them helpful.  Pay attention to the Flow of Control exercises
